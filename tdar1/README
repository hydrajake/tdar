# To use tdar, a time-dar.json file must be present on your Ubuntu machine.
# Copy the JSON file you want to examine to the root directory of your Ubuntu machine.
# Open your Ubuntu terminal and ensure you are in the root directory.
# 
# Execute tdar using the following format:
# 	tdar [-b or -s] <file_name> [field_name] [date]
# 
# Options and arguments:
# 	-b : Break mode. Lists each date entry one by one. Press Enter to continue through dates.
# 	-s : Summary mode. Skips the full listing and generates the complete totals for the file.
# 	<file_name> : Required. Must be entered in full. Should be the first argument or immediately follow -b if used.
# 	[field_name] : Optional. Specify a single field to total.
# 	[date] : Optional. Must be in mm-dd-yyyy format (use dashes only, no slashes or periods).
# 
# Notes:
# 	field_name and date can be interchangeable in order if only one is provided.
# 	If both field_name and date are provided, order does not matter.
# 
# Examples:
# 	tdar testDAR.json
# 	tdar testDAR.json TotalSales 10-20-2025
# 	tdar testDAR.json 10-20-2025
# 	tdar -b testDAR.json
# 	tdar -s testDAR.json TotalSales
